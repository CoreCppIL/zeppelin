  name: "Chris"
  surname: "Gearing"
  bio: >
    <p>I’m a Principle Software Engineer at Mobileye who prefers the quiet satisfaction of solving problems through well-crafted code. I gravitate toward C++, where I enjoy the challenge of designing systems that are both expressive and maintainable. I take a certain pride in writing code that improves with age—becoming more malleable, less brittle, and ideally, less surprising.</p>
    <p>These days, I spend more time trying to help others appreciate software as a form of engineering with artistic undertones. When done thoughtfully, it’s both powerful and rewarding—though “thoughtfully” is a vague term that defies precise definition, which is probably why I keep revisiting it.</p>
    <p>When I’m not writing or refactoring code, I’m often on a motorcycle, enjoying the kind of speed that doesn’t involve a compiler.</p>
